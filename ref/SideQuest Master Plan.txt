1. Executive Summary
SideQuest is an AI-powered mobile application that revolutionizes how Gen Z discovers and pursues side
hustles. Instead of overwhelming users with generic "make money online" lists, SideQuest uses advanced AI to
analyze each user's unique skills, available time, resources, and goals to provide personalized side hustle
recommendations called "quests."

The Problem
Gen Z faces a unique economic challenge: traditional entry-level jobs often don't pay enough to cover living
expenses, yet they possess diverse skills and entrepreneurial ambitions. Current solutions are inadequate: •
Generic side hustle lists don't consider individual circumstances
• Overwhelming options lead to decision paralysis
• No clear path from idea to first dollar earned
• Lack of personalization wastes time on ill-fitting opportunities

The Solution
SideQuest transforms side hustle discovery into an engaging, gamified experience: 1. Personalized AI
Matching: Claude AI analyzes user profiles to suggest 5-10 highly relevant side hustles with realistic earning
potential.

2. Gaming-Inspired UX: Each side hustle is a "quest" with clear objectives, progress tracking, and
achievement rewards, making the journey fun and motivating.

3. Action-Oriented Guidance: Every quest includes detailed, step-by-step action plans to go from zero to first
dollar earned.

4. Progress Tracking: Users can log earnings, track time invested, and measure ROI for each quest they
pursue.

Market Opportunity
• Target Market: 68 million Gen Z individuals in the US (ages 18-25)
• Addressable Market: 45% actively seeking side income (30.6 million)
• Market Size: $15+ billion (estimated at $500/year per user)
• Growth Trend: Gig economy growing 17% annually
• Competition: No direct AI-powered competitors focusing on Gen Z

■ Financial Snapshot

Initial Investment: $500-1,000 (mainly marketing)
Monthly Operating Cost: ~$100 (scales with users)
Break-Even: ~300 premium subscribers (Month 3-4)
Year 1 Revenue Target: $180,000
Year 1 Profit Margin: 75%+



2. App Overview & Concept
Core Concept
SideQuest gamifies the side hustle discovery process by framing each opportunity as a "quest" with clear
objectives, rewards (earnings), and milestones. This approach: • Makes side hustling feel less overwhelming
and more achievable
• Leverages Gen Z's familiarity with gaming mechanics
• Creates shareable moments for social media (quest completions, earnings)
• Builds habit through daily engagement and streak tracking

User Journey
• Download & Onboarding (2 minutes): Quick quiz about skills, time, resources, and goals
• AI Quest Generation (30 seconds): Claude analyzes profile and suggests 5 personalized quests
• Quest Discovery: Swipe through quest cards (Tinder-style), save interesting ones
• Quest Details: View earning potential, difficulty, time commitment, and why it matches
• Start Quest: Access step-by-step action plan with checkboxes
• Track Progress: Mark steps complete, log first earnings, celebrate milestones
• Level Up: Earn XP, unlock achievements, access new quest categories

Quick Start: Build Your MVP
Prerequisites:
• Node.js 18+ installed
• VS Code or Cursor IDE
• Expo Go app on your phone
• Supabase account (free tier)
• Anthropic API key

Step 1: Create Project (5 minutes)
npx create-expo-app@latest sidequest-app --template
# Choose: blank (TypeScript)
cd sidequest-app

# Install core dependencies
npx expo install react-native-reanimated moti
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @anthropic-ai/sdk
npm install zustand react-hook-form zod
npm install nativewind tailwindcss@3.3.2

Step 2: Setup Supabase (10 minutes)
1. Create new project at supabase.com
2. Copy your project URL and anon key
3. Run the database setup script (provided in docs)
4. Enable Row Level Security policies

Step 3: Configure Environment (2 minutes)
# Create .env file
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

Step 4: Start Development (immediate)
npx expo start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app

Step 5: Build First Screen (Week 1)
Start with authentication screens using provided templates in the /code-templates folder.

Recommended AI Coding Assistants:
• Cursor IDE (best for this project)
• GitHub Copilot
• v0.dev for UI components



Final Notes & Next Steps
■ Remember These Key Points:

1. Start with MVP: Don't try to build everything at once. Launch with core features (onboarding, quest
generation, basic tracking) and iterate based on real user feedback.

2. Use AI to Build Faster: Tools like Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, and Claude can speed up development by
3-5x. Don't write everything from scratch.

3. Test Early and Often: Get the app in users' hands by Week 5. Their feedback is more valuable than
perfecting features in isolation.

4. Focus on Quest Quality: The AI recommendations need to be genuinely helpful. Spend time refining
prompts and testing different user profiles.

5. Marketing Starts Day 1: Build an audience while building the product. Share progress on TikTok, Twitter,
and relevant communities.
